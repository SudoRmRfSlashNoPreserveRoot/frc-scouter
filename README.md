# FRC Scouter by Team 2898
This is a scouting app for First Robotics Competition events. It is currently in early development and is accessible [here](https://droid-kk11.github.io/frc-scouter).
If you are indeed at that address, this README will be replaced by the actual scouting once it is first published.
